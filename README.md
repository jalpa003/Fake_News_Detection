# Fake_News_Detection

This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning algorithms. 

The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files: 'True.csv' and 'Fake.csv', which contain true and fake news articles respectively.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- pathlib
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip, like so:

``` pip install pandas numpy pathlib matplotlib wordcloud sklearn ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file 'Fake News Detection.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and test the models.
4. To manually test the models, enter a news article when prompted by the manual_testing() function.

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the University of Victoria: Fake News Detection Datasets.

This project was completed as part of the Capstone Project 1 for the DAB program at St. Clair College.
